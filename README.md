I learnt basics of computer hardware arithmetics and Assembly Language and used this project to 

Using MIPS32, I could implement Booth's Algoritm for multiplication. Booth's algorithm simplifies the amount of arithmetic operations necessary to do a multiplication by implementing a Look Up Table. 
My implementation assumes 8 bits signed integers for operations. The program has basic console input and output for data collection and displaying operations and result.
Things I would love to improve at this moment are:
- Input validation: checking that the input is within rage (-128 to 128)
- Binary convertion: converting numbers to binary to print them in the console to better understand the steps
- Restart and exit event: Loop the program so it asks user to input more set of numbers until a certain exit event.
